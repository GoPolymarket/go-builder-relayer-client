# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

We only provide security fixes for the **latest commit on the `main` branch**.

- ✅ Supported: `main` (latest commit)
- ❌ Unsupported: tagged releases older than `main`, other branches, forks, and any historical commits

If you are running an older commit, please upgrade to the latest `main` before reporting.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **report security issues privately**. Do not create a public issue with sensitive details.

### Preferred channel

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (Repository → **Security** tab → “Report a vulnerability”)

### If GitHub Security Advisories are not available

1. Create a **minimal public GitHub issue** that **does not include sensitive information** (no PoCs, exploit details, secrets, private endpoints, or user data).
2. In the issue, request a **private communication channel** for follow-up.

### What to include

To help us triage quickly, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (or a minimal PoC shared privately)
- Affected component(s) and commit hash / version
- Any relevant logs (sanitized) and environment details

### Response time

We aim to **acknowledge receipt within 3 business days**.

## Disclosure Policy

Please avoid public disclosure until:

- a fix or mitigation is available, and
- disclosure timing has been coordinated with the maintainers.

We will work with you on a responsible disclosure timeline and will credit reporters when appropriate (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
